				<h5 class="clr-burgandy">Synopsis</h5>
				<p class="small mb-2">Everything in life happens for some reasons and each incident has a lot to tell you. This is true even in case of the failures. Here's a couple of things I learned from my entrepreneurship stint earlier.</p>
				<hr>
				<p class="mb-2">Soon after college days, I set out for entrepreneurship and co-founded a couple of startups along with my friends. The first one always showed a stable trajectory since its inception and it certainly bloomed well. We were all excited. So I decided to take this experience and confidence onto starting a second one, by quitting the first. The second one, however was a lot different from the first, and a lot more challenging. Anyhow, around 3 years later, when I thought we were ready to scale up, some unforeseen events occurred and we had to shut that up.</p>

				<p class="mb-2">I was broke, in fact, too much. I had put my whole self into it, and so it crushed my spirit and I didn’t had the courage to do anything further. But the time has flown by and when I look back at it, there are many positives that came from the mishap. Here are just a couple of them.</p>

				<div class="accordion mb-2" id="accordion">
				  <div class="card">
				    <div class="card-header" id="headingOne">
				    	<h5>
				      		<a href="" class="collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseOne" aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="collapseOne">The balance</a>
				    	</h5>
				    </div>
				    <div id="collapseOne" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingOne" data-parent="#accordion">
				      <div class="card-body">
				      	<p>
				        I think I was focusing on one or more things too much while some others (which should have been) weren't paid much attention to. In short, there could have been a better balance between various things. Just as in a curry, there are different ingredients, but when one or two ingredients are present in excess (or less), it doesn't make that same curry. This points to the fact that along with ingredients, balance is also vital. In life too, everything has its own place, a hierarchy and a priority. This incident gave an opportunity to rethink about certain things and put them into perspective.

				        Not many know Buzz Aldrin, the second person to land on the Moon after Neil Armstrong. Not taking any credit away from Neil, but this also suggests something else - the human nature of finding interest only in the high level picture normally like win/fail, yes/no and likewise. But in general, it is suggested that, along with high level information, we should also develop a habit of caring for the details. This will pay way for many improvements, understanding how close we are to something and then make better judgement of things.

				<p class=" mb-2">Both these principles appear very much practical to me even now and thanks to my failure. But, I don’t have the opinion that failures are always necessary to gain understanding :P I too hope that I will back on the pursuit again soon.</p>

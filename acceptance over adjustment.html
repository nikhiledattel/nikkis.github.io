					<h5 class="clr-burgandy">Synopsis</h5>	
					<p class="small mb-2">Adjustment is a very common practice we all do in our day to day life. Generally, it involves making minor changes within or the environment around in order to better align something towards it's result. It is more relevant in short term goals.</p>
					<hr>
					<p class="small mb-2">In a more orderly establishments, adjustment have certain limitations. This is because the level of relationship between the people are deeper and the goals could be long term. First and foremost, relationship between such tightly coupled people should not be compromised while making adjustments. Again, since each adjustment asks for certain level of compromises, this cannot go indefinite, as no one can endure pain for so long.</p>
					<h5 class="clr-burgandy">A surer way</h5>	
					<p class="small mb-2">If we analyse closely, the adjustments are more focussed on the environment around us, not us. But practically, we can control ourselves better than the environment around us. So think about making the focus towards oneself ie, we become the epicenter of change leaving the environment as is (or with minimum change) and this can be called as acceptance. We will then approach the entire goal from a different perspective while improvising and pushing our own limits. This way, not only we can achieve the goals and the relationships can be preserved, but also see a more evolved version of yourself at the end of the process. So typically in a family, friendship or even a core office group, acceptance is more vital than adjustment

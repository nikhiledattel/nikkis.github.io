				<!-- <h4 class="">Architecture is a wonderful thing to watch and learn</h4> -->

				<h3>What I learned from my mom and dad</h3>
				<p class="small">They are the pillars of my brother's and my life. They continue to stand strong and inspire us all. Unendingly, I owe them for my life, and there are 3 key things I try to imitate from them, among many others.</p>
				
				<h4 class="">Complementary is the best</h4>
				<p class="">There are superlative strengths in both of them, so as certain weak links. But this doesn't matter from loving each other and having a mutual respect. Their individual weak link is the natural strength of the other. So differences are not a matter of concern once we choose to accept each other and thus everything becomes united and work as a strength.</p>
				
				<h4 class="">Be Authentic</h4>
				<p class="">Put up your own personality, not the fake one. Often we pretend to be someone else other than us in front of others. We don't necessarilyÂ enjoy it, but do that out of the peer pressure. But only if we grow in strength to overcome it, shall we really discover life that satisfies us.</p>

				<h4 class="">Be Humble</h4>
				<p class="">Never forget the ways we've come in. Also, it's not always me or someone else, but all together. Of all things, to be as family unceasingly is the most important thing. For this, there is a need to give space for each other in order to grow and contribute. And to make it happen, we need to have the virtue of humbleness.</p>

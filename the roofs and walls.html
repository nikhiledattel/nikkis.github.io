				<p class="small mb-2">They are the pillars of my brother's and my life. They continue to stand strong and inspire us all. Unendingly, I owe them for my life, and there are 3 key things I try to imitate from them, among many others.</p>
				<hr>
				<p class="small mb-2">Couple of years before, we were in the process of building our current house. Everyone in family took up various initiatives in connection with the same. I did most of the research, while my daddy covered all the paper works, and oversaw the entire construction work. My mummy stood as the glue between our family and associated people and supported in all things. My brother and grandma too did their part. We are indeed thankful to lot of others people, who lend their time and skill to help us realise our collective dream.</p>
				<p class="small mb-2">During those days, we were working so tirelessly, but with some real passion. Involving in a constructing was the first time in our life and there used to be frequent discussion about various things. Even though, the code ideology about the house was same for all, there used to be strict difference of opinions in certain matters, say be the colour of tiles or cupboard lamination, placement of certain things etc. We used to debate, but not every time we arrived into a logical conclusion. Eventually, we took some decision and moved on. So in reality, not everything in the house is as everyone envisaged. Somethings are there because somebody wanted it like that, and for that, others had to turn down their plans. But I believe this is the greatest achievement of all, wherein our house, there are contributions from everyone, and it is everyone’s. Though initially, it was painful and I thought that the best was being thrown away, but I realised later that it has paved way for even better result. Else, it would have been just some roofs and walls. Where there’s mutual respect and a healthy space for other’s opinions, that’s becomes our home.</p>				
				<h5 class="clr-burgandy">Trivial Facts</h5>
				<p class="small mb-2">We got our designs done through Arch. Roopa (and her team), an absolutely sensible architect and my schoolmate. The execution part was guided by yet another amazing architect, Ajith, who is such a down to earth person, and a close relative of ours. The interior works were mostly carried out through my aunty Rosy and her husband, both specialising in interior designs</p>

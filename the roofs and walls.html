				<h5 class="clr-burgandy">Synopsis</h5>
				<p class="small mb-2">Couple of years ago, we were in the process of building our current house. Involving in such a project was the first time for all of us. I realized that beyond meticulous planning and stringent execution, there are more things that make up its success.</p>
				<hr>
				<p class="small mb-2">During those days, everyone in the family took up various initiatives in connection with the same. I did most of the research, while my daddy covered all the paper works, and oversaw the entire construction work. My mummy was the glue between us and various technicians/workers. My brother and grandma too did their part.</p>
				<p class="small mb-2">We were working so tirelessly and passionately. There used to be frequent discussion about various things and even though the core ideology about the project was same for all, there used to be strict differences of opinions in many matters, be it the colour of tiles or cupboard lamination, location of certain rooms/things etc. We used to debate, but not every time we arrived at a logical conclusion. Eventually, we made some decisions and moved on. So in short, not everything in the house is as everyone envisaged. Some things are there because somebody wanted it like that, and for that, others had to let go of their plans. So there are contributions from everyone and I think this is the greatest achievement of all. Though initially, it was painful and I thought that the best was being thrown away by the sacrifices. But it wasn't the case. Where there's mutual respect, there's a space for others opinions and that is infact a home. Else, I'm afraid it would have been just some roofs and walls.</p>				
				<h5 class="clr-burgandy">Trivial Facts</h5>
				<p class="small mb-2">We got our designs done through my schoolmate and a really sensible architect -  Arch. Roopa (and her team). The execution part was done under the guidance of yet another amazing architect, Arch. Ajith, who is such a down to earth person and relatable in all means. The interior works were mostly carried out through my aunty Rosy and her husband, both specialising in interior designs.</p>

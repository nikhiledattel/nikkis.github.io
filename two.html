				<h3>The need for acceptance over adjustment</h3>
				<!-- <p class="small">They are the pillars of my brother's and my life. They continue to stand strong and inspire us all. Unendingly, I owe them for my life, and there are 3 key things I try to imitate from them, among many others.</p> -->
				
				<!-- <h4 class="">Adjustment</h4> -->
				<p class="">Adjustment is a common process we all do when trying to achieve something. As we know, it focuses on bringing changes in the environment to better align something towards it's result. It is well suited for realizing short term goals.</p>
				
				<h4 class="">The downside</h4>
				<p class="">In more serious establishments whose duration is more, such as family, friendship or even a core office group, however, there is a limit for mere adjustments. This is so because of two main reasons - the level of relationship here is deeper and the goals are long term. We cannot compromise relationship while adjusting, Again, untill you're done, there can be lot of frustation and pain.</p>

				<h4 class="">A surer way</h4>
				<p class="">Here is the necessity of acceptance. We try to to take the situation or people as is and then work towards the same goal. In the former, the idea is to change situation or others around us, but here change is more about oneself. Since this will ask us to push our own limits, we can hope to see ourselves more evolved at the end of the process. Again, remember that we can better control ourselves than others and so this is more likely a surer way.</p>
